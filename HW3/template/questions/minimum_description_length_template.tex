\section{ MDL on a toy dataset}

We provide a data set (train\_data.mat, train\_y.mat, test\_data.mat, test\_y.mat) generated from a particular model with $N=64$. We want to estimate

\begin{equation*}
 \hat{y} =  w_1 x_1 + w_2 x_2 + w_3 x_3 
\end{equation*}

We want to use MDL to find the 'optimal' $L_0$-penalized model.

\begin{enumerate}
\item  Estimate the three linear regressions \\

(We could actually try all possible subsets here, but instead we'll just try three.)

\begin{align*}
  y_1& = w_1 x_1 \\
  y_2& = w_1 x_1 + w_2 x_2 \\
  y_3& = w_1 x_1 + w_2 x_2 + w_3 x_3  \\
\end{align*}

For each of the three cases, what is
\begin{enumerate}
\item the sum of square error \\
i)   $\text{Err}_1 = $ \\
ii)  $\text{Err}_2 = $\\
iii) $\text{Err}_3 = $\\


\item 2 times the estimated bits to code the residual ($n \log{\frac{Error}{n}} $)  \\
i)    $\text{ERR}\_\text{bits}_1 = $ \\
ii)   $\text{ERR}\_\text{bits}_2 = $ \\
iii)  $\text{ERR}\_\text{bits}_3 = $ \\


\item 2 times the estimated bits to code each residual plus model under AIC ($2*1$ bit to code each feature) \\
i)    $\text{AIC}\_\text{bits}_1 = $ \\
ii)   $\text{AIC}\_\text{bits}_2 = $ \\
iii)  $\text{AIC}\_\text{bits}_3 = $ \\


\item 2 times the estimated bits to code each residual plus model under BIC  ($2*(1/2) log(n)$ bits to code each feature) \\
i)   $\text{BIC}\_\text{bits}_1 = $ \\
ii)  $\text{BIC}\_\text{bits}_2 = $ \\
iii) $\text{BIC}\_\text{bits}_3 = $ \\

\end{enumerate}


\item Which model has the smallest minimum description length? \\
a) for AIC \\
b) for BIC\\


\item  Included in the kit is a test data set; does the error on the test set for the three models
   correspond to what is expected from MDLs?  Please compute and show the test errors and briefly explain it in one sentence. Please use your model to obtain these values, and know that we will be checking them against values obtained using $fminsearch$.


\end{enumerate}
