function labels = kernel_regression(Xtrain,Ytrain,Xtest,sigma)

    % Function that implements kernel regression on the given data (binary classification)
    % Usage: labels = kernel_regression(Xtrain,Ytrain,Xtest)
    
    % Xtrain : N x P Matrix of training data, where N is the number of
    %   training examples, and P is the dimensionality (number of features)
    % Ytrain : N x 1 Vector of training labels (0/1)
    % Xtest : M x P Matrix of testing data, where M is the number of
    %   testing examples.
    % sigma : width of the (gaussian) kernel.
    % labels : return an M x 1 vector of predicted labels for testing data.
