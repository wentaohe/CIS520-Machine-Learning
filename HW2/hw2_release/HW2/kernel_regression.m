function labels = kernel_regression(Xtrain,Y_train,Xtest,sigma)

    % Function that implements kernel regression on the given data (binary classification)
    % Usage: labels = kernel_regression(Xtrain,Ytrain,Xtest)
    
    % Xtrain : N x P Matrix of training data, where N is the number of
    %   training examples, and P is the dimensionality (number of features)
    % Ytrain : N x 1 Vector of training labels (0/1)
    % Xtest : M x P Matrix of testing data, where M is the number of
    %   testing examples.
    % sigma : width of the (gaussian) kernel.
    % labels : return an M x 1 vector of predicted labels for testing data.
   

    % NOTE: this code is heavily VECTORIZED, which means that it does not use a
    % any "for" loops and runs very quickly. Understanding this code is a
    % good exercise for learning how to write programs in Matlab that run very
    % fast.

    % The following lines compute the difference between every test point and
    % every train point in each dimension separately, using a single M x P X N
    % 3-D array subtraction:
    
    % Step 1:  Reshape the N x P training matrix into a 1 X P x N 3-D array
    trainMat = reshape(Xtrain', [1 size(Xtrain,2) numTrainPoints]);
    % Step 2:  Replicate the training array for each test point (1st dim)
    trainCompareMat = repmat(trainMat, [numTestPoints 1 1]);
    % Step 3:  Replicate the test array for each training point (3rd dim)
    testCompareMat = repmat(Xtest, [1 1 numTrainPoints]);
    % Step 4:  Element-wise subtraction
    diffMat = testCompareMat - trainCompareMat;
    
    % Now we can compute the distance functions on these element-wise
    % differences:
    distMat = sqrt(sum(diffMat.^2, 2));
    
    % Now we have a M x 1 x N 3-D array of distances between each pair of
    % points. We squeeze this to a M x N matrix, then use these distances to
    % compute the corresponding M x N kernel matrix:
    
    distMat = squeeze(distMat);
    if numTestPoints == 1 % squeeze will make this a column vector if only 1 point
        distMat = distMat';
    end
    
    kernMat = exp(-distMat.^2/sigma.^2);
    
    % Next, replicate the training label matrix to become M x N:
    trainLabels = repmat(Ytrain', numTestPoints, 1);
    % Finally, compute a weighted average over the M rows using the kernel:
    labels = sum(trainLabels.*kernMat,2)./sum(kernMat,2);
    labels = labels > 0;
    
    labels(labels>=0.5)=1;
    labels(labels<0.5)=0;
